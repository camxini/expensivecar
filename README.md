# expensivecar
**Phase1:** ZJU SRTP Program - A car using Raspberry Pi for route planning

Finished on 24 May, 2025

This is a car with Raspberry Pi 4B, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, RPLIDAR A1, two coding motors and L298N motor drive model.

I call it expensivecar because it cost me over 1800 RMB.

All the files in ubuntu of Raspberry Pi has laid here, and details are shown in another markdown file.
